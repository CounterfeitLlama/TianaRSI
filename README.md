## Libraries used in project

### [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

Used for general facial recognition

## Libraries being considered

### [USB4Java](https://github.com/usb4java/usb4java)

Used to connect robot to computer

Pros:
* Wired to computer will provide fastest connection possible
* Easier to implement
* Draw power straight from computer

Cons:
* Wired will decrease mobility for robot if the robot wants to be placed in a separate room

### [Bluecove](https://github.com/hcarver/bluecove)

Used to connect robot to computer

Pros:
* Bluetooth will allow robot to be able to be moved to other locations easily

Cons:
* Will need external power source
* Slower connection speed
* Difficult to implement

## Additional notes

At the beginning of the project, I believe I will implement USB4Java so I can easier focus on the heart of the project: facial recognition. However, as the project moves onwards and if I have the time, I would prefer to implement Bluecove, especially if the connection speed is relatively the same.
